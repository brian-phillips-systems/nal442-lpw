# Latin Plate Witness (LPW) — Paris, BnF n.a.l. 442

## Scope and Purpose

This repository section contains a complete **Latin Plate Witness (LPW)** for the Psalter portion of  
**Paris, Bibliothèque nationale de France, n.a.l. 442** (the Tironian Psalter).

The LPW corpus provides **page-level textual attestation** of the Latin words present on each manuscript plate (page), without asserting numeric, positional, or editorial authority.

Its sole purpose is to witness **word presence** per plate.

## What an LPW File Is

Each LPW file is a **plate-scoped witness** that records:

- The Latin words attested on that manuscript page
- In reading order
- With verse markers preserved only as visual/reading aids

An LPW **does not** assert:

- POS ranges
- Word counts as authoritative
- Alignment to any external tokenization
- Editorial corrections or normalization
- Interpretive claims about the manuscript

It is a **presence witness**, not a critical edition.

## What “Plate” Means Here

In LPW terms, a *plate* means:

> A manuscript page for which the **opening and closing textual boundaries** have been manually checked and confirmed.

No claim is made about:
- internal lineation
- token boundaries
- quantitative completeness beyond presence

## Relationship to Other Project Materials

LPW files are designed to coexist with, but remain independent from:

- POS-indexed corpora
- Interlinear alignment layers
- PLATE WYSIWYG transcriptions
- Future programmatic typecasting or analysis

LPW may be safely cited, diffed, or redistributed **without dependency on any numeric or positional schema**.

## Status

**CERTIFIED / CLOSED**

This LPW corpus reflects the completed Damage Control phase of the Latin Psalter transcription process.

No further validation is required **unless the underlying Latin text itself is revised**.

## Intended Use

LPW is suitable for:

- Citation of manuscript word presence
- Cross-checking against other witnesses
- Anchoring later analytical or alignment work
- Human verification workflows

It is intentionally conservative in scope.

## Non-Goals

This corpus does **not** attempt to:

- Replace critical editions
- Resolve textual variants
- Encode semantic or grammatical structure
- Impose editorial authority

Those tasks belong to downstream layers.
